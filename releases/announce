Pascal Obry and Olivier Ramonat are pleased to announce the launch of
Vision2Pixels Web application. This application is oriented toward
photography critics.

As photographers we used another Web application some time ago, the
maintainers have decided to close it, and as the code was not Open Source,
nobody was able to take the maintenance back. So we decided two years ago
to launch this project and to start for good as a GPL project. At least
this project won't depend on our will or energy to continue it or not.

The Web interface is in French and oriented toward French critics only.

This project is built in Ada (hence the post in this forum) and is using
AWS/Ajax support (the new AWS's Web_Block Ajax support is born while
building Vision2Pixels as the templates2ada tool) and Gwiad dynamic
plug-in project from Olivier.

We just put out the first release, please bear with us, it is not perfect
and is missing many features (like searching). We plan to continue working
on this project of course, even if the goal is more to used it to post our
own pictures.

We take the opportunity to call for contributions. We have no designer on
the project and needs help on the core Ada too. The code comments and issue
tracker are all in English.

In any case this is a good show-case for Ada and Ajax.

It builds fine with latest GNAT GPL 2007.

During the project we have switched from Subversion to Mercurial then to
Git. Git is really wonderful but this is another story.

Vision2Pixels code is on a Git archive:

     $ git clone git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/v2p.git

It depends on some other projects:

   > gnadelite (simple GNADE distribution supporting only Sqlite3):

     $ git clone git://repo.or.cz/gnadelite.git

   > Dynamic Plug-in support, Vision2Pixels is a plug-in:

     $ git clone git://repo.or.cz/gwiad.git

   > A support library:

     $ git clone git://repo.or.cz/morzhol.git

   > A Wiki:

     $ git clone git://repo.or.cz/diouzhut.git

   > ImageMagick Ada binding from Ali Bendriss (distributed with Vision2Pixels):

     $ https://gna.org/projects/g2f/

Thanks to everyone for the help received, notably to host the project.
And thanks also to AdaCore for the GNAT GPL compiler.

Visions2Pixels Team.

Notes on the releases handling.
-------------------------------

Every commits are done on master.

When a release is about to be ready a branch is created (vX.Y):

   $ git co -b v2.0

If important fixes are made (committed on master) they are merged into this
branch:

   $ git cherry-pick <sha1>

or:

   $ git merge --log --no-ff <branch_name>

For this branch_name must be rebased on current branch.

   $ git rebase --onto v2.0 branch_name^ branch_name
   (if there is a single commit)

When the release is fully ready a corresponding tag is created (vX.Y.Z):

   $ git tag -a v2.0.0
   $ git push --tags

Then the package is created with:

   $ make distrib

The resulting tarball will be named using the latest tag.

If interim releases are needed to fix some important bug, as before they are
committed to master and merged into the branch. The numbering will be either
2.1.0 or 2.0.1 depending of the importance of the fixes.

Let's say a very small clean up of the layout of a page has been done. Now
that it is merged into the v2.0 branch we are ready to create the interim
release:

   $ git tag -a v2.0.1
   $ git push --tags
   $ make distrib

Notes on installing v2p
-----------------------

On the machine. Installation is as follow:

application :  /usr/local/lib/v2p/
db, images  :  /var/lib/v2p/
logs        :  /var/log/v2p/

When installtion a new version only the application is updated.

   $ cd /usr/local/lib/v2p/

At this location run the prepare-install.sh script with the version of current
server and the version of new sever as parameter:

   $ ./prepare-install.sh 2.0.0 2.1.0

The new version must match a file named:

   $HOME/v2p-linux-i686-v2.1.0.tgz

Note that the first time v2p is installed a set of external libraries must be
installed. See releases/package-externals.sh script.

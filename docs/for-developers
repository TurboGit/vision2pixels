Note for developpers
====================

Releases
--------

When a new release is ready.

1. create a tag

   $ git tag -a v1.0.0

2. create the corresponding archive

   $ make && make install-distrib

The distribution tarball will be named using the last tag found on the
master branch. So there is nothing special to do.

Release Branches
----------------

All commits goes to the master branch.

Bug fixes are merged back into the appropriate branch after approval
from all maintainers.

If the branch is not yet created it needs to be created stating from the last
release tag:

   $ git branch v1.0 v1.0.0

Which create the branch named 1.0 starting from release tag v1.0.

After fixing the issues a new corrective release is ready. It will be named
v1.0.1. Just create the appropriate tag into the v1.0 branch.

   $ git co v1.0
   $ git tag -a v1.0.1

Naming convention
-----------------

   branches: v<major>.<minor>
   tags:     v<major>.<minor>.<micro>

So branches are named v<major>.<minor> whereas the tags are named
v<major>.<minor>.<micro>. <micro> is 0 for the initial version and
incremented for each corrective releases.

Developpers Branches
--------------------

As Git permits to create branches locally for whatever reasons there is no
specific rules to follow except if the branch is to be shared with others.

In the case the branch must be named starting with the developper initial,
a slash and then the branch name. For example, Pascal Obry will create the
branches as follow:

   $ git co -b po/new-topic

Style Guide
-----------

We follow closely the AWS's Style Guide for the Ada code. You can find a
copy of this document on the AWS Subversion archive.

Using style_check pre-commit hook will catch many mistakes. It is strongly
encouraged to setup it.

See ready to use pre-commit hook in the git-scripts repository:

   $ git clone git://repo.or.cz/git-scripts.git
